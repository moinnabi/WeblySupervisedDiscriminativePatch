ExemplarSVM debug demos

Author: Tomasz Malisiewicz (tomasz@cmu.edu)

This directory contains some debug demos which I used while building the Exemplar-SVM framework.
They produce pretty pictures, you should have fun with them.

To run the framing debugging demo, in Matlab run:

    publish('demo_framing','pdf')

This will generate the resulting pdf:
