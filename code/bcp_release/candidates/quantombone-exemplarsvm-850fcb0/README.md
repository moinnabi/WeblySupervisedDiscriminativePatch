### Abstract

This paper proposes a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method which combines the effectiveness of a discriminative object detector with the explicit correspondence offered by a nearest-neighbor approach. The method is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set. Each of these Exemplar-SVMs is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. While each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such Exemplar-SVMs offers surprisingly good generalization. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of Felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. But the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. Because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3D model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.

This object recognition library is a combination of:

* [libsvm-3.0-1](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)

* fast blas convolution code (from [voc-release-4.0](http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pff/latent/)), 

* 31-D HOG feature code (from [voc-release-3.1](http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pff/latent/)), 

* Localization within a pyramid code (using both sliding windows and fast block-based method), and exemplar-svm training

* [VOC development code](http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/) imported from the PASCAL VOC website
